# Pre-launch License

**Talentwork** is a _SaaS boilerplate_ that grants you a non-exclusive lifetime license for up to 5 developers.

As long as you have an active subscription, you'll have access to the private repository for monthly or yearly updates.

The subscription's price is [$99/month](https://alexandromg.gumroad.com/l/Talentwork?tier=Core%20Features%20%F0%9F%AA%A8) for the Core features, and [$149/month](https://alexandromg.gumroad.com/l/Talentwork?tier=Enterprise%20Features%20%F0%9F%9A%80) for the Enterprise features that are currently under construction (Workflows, Internationalization, Feature flags, and more).

You can:

- Use the _SaaS boilerplate_ to create unlimited _Websites_.
- Use the _SaaS boilerplate_ to create unlimited _Websites_ for unlimited _Clients_.
- Use the _SaaS boilerplate_ to create _Websites_ where the _Website_ is sold to _End Users_.

You cannot:

- Share with your team the _SaaS boilerplate_ to do any of the above.
- Use the _SaaS boilerplate_ to create _Websites_ that are designed to allow an _End User_ to build their own End Products using the _SaaS boilerplate_.
- Re-distribute the _SaaS boilerplate_ separately from an End Product, neither in code or as design assets.

Examples of usage **allowed** by the license:

- Creating a personal _Website_ by yourself
- Creating a _Website_ or web application for a _Client_ that will be owned by that _Client_
- Creating a commercial _Website_, where _End Users_ have to pay a fee to use the application
- Creating a commercial self-hosted web application that is sold to _End Users_ for a one-time fee

Examples of usage **not allowed** by the license:

- Creating a _Website_ with your _Team_
- Creating a repository of the _SaaS boilerplate_ and publishing it publicly
- Creating a "_Website_ builder" project where _End Users_ can build their own Websites using the _components_ included with or derived from the _SaaS boilerplate_
- Creating a template kit using the _SaaS boilerplate_ and making it available either for sale or for free
- Creating a web application where the primary purpose is clearly not to simply re-distribute the _SaaS boilerplate_ that is free or open source
