# Update Logo and Icon

## Goals:

- Change the Logo and Icon _(light and dark mode)_

## Steps

ðŸ’¿ Open your local folder `app/assets/img`.

There are 4 files there:

- **logo-light.png**
- **logo-dark.png**
- **icon-light.png**
- **icon-dark.png**

They're use througout the application with the `app/components/front/Logo.tsx` and `app/components/front/Icon.tsx` components.

<InfoBanner title="NOTE">
  If you plan tu support dark mode, it's important to set
  the <b>logo-dark</b> and <b>icon-dark</b> images.
</InfoBanner>
