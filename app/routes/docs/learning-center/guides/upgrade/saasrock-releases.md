# SaasRock releases

The following steps are my recommendation to constantly stay up to date with SaasRock releases.

<WarningBanner title="WARNING">
  There will be constant breaking changes until SaasRock is stable. 
  This gives me the flexibility to add new features with freedom.
</WarningBanner>

ðŸ’¿ Create a private GitHub repository with the SaasRock's latest release.

ðŸ’¿ Set SaasRock as the upstream

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AlexandroMtzG/saasrock.git
```

ðŸ’¿ _(Optional)_ [Remove push to upstream](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10260389/5697060).

```shell
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```

If you run git remote -v you should get something like this:

```shell
origin  https://github.com/{YOU}/{YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO}.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/{YOU}/{YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO}.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/AlexandroMtzG/saasrock.git (fetch)
upstream        no_push (push)
```

ðŸ’¿ Anytime you want to get the latest changes, run:

```shell
git pull upstream main
```

This way you decide when to pull the latest features.
